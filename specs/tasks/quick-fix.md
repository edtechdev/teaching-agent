# Task: quick-fix

## Purpose

Fast, focused correction of a single well-defined issue in an existing material file, without running a full co-authoring session.

Equivalent to BMAD's "Quick Flow" — minimal overhead for small, targeted changes (typos, broken syntax, swapping one example, fixing a quiz answer, correcting a link).

## Inputs

- `number`: session number
- `type`: session type (`lecture` or `exercise`)
- `description`: what to fix (brief, e.g., "Typo in section 3", "Fix quiz syntax in slide 5", "Replace example for learning objective 2")
- `materials/{number}-{type}.md` — the file to change
- `docs/context.md` — for conventions and terminology
- `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md` — for syntax reference if the fix involves LiaScript

## Output

- Updated `materials/{number}-{type}.md` (single targeted change only)
- Short inline confirmation of what was changed and PASS/FAIL of mini-validation

## Steps

1. **Scope confirmation:** State what will be changed and the acceptance criterion:
   - "I will [describe the change] in `materials/{number}-{type}.md`. The change is complete when [condition]. Correct? (Yes / Adjust scope)"

2. **Make the targeted change only** — no refactoring, no adjacent edits, no style improvements beyond the stated fix.

3. **Mini-validation of the affected section:**
   - LiaScript syntax correct in the changed area?
   - Persona/tone consistent with `docs/didactics.md`?
   - No unintended regression in surrounding content?

4. **Report result:**
   - ✅ "Fix applied and validated — done."
   - ⚠️ "The problem is larger than expected: [describe]. Should I open `/coauthor-materials {number} {type}`?"

5. **Escalate if scope grows:** If the fix reveals structural issues or multiple sections need rework, stop and escalate to `/coauthor-materials` — do NOT proceed silently.

| Wrong link or missing alt text       | `/quick-fix`          |
| Swap one example or code snippet     | `/quick-fix`          |
| Fix one quiz answer                  | `/quick-fix`          |
| Multiple sections need rework        | `/coauthor-materials` |
| Learning objective not covered       | `/coauthor-materials` |
| Structural or content change         | `/coauthor-materials` |
| Persona tone inconsistent throughout | `/coauthor-materials` |
