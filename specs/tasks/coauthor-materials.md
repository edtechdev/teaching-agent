# Task: coauthor-materials

## Purpose

Enables the agent **in the professor persona** to act as a co-author when creating and refining lecture materials.  
This task is **interactive**: instructors discuss content, tone, and structure with the agent before these are incorporated into the materials.
Suggest images for visualization, either as a search term or as a concrete image prompt. Images can be inserted as diagrams (e.g., Mermaid, ASCII art).

**IMPORTANT:** Strictly follow the LiaScript syntax rules, especially for headings and slide structure (see `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md`).

## Inputs

- Professor persona & style from `docs/course-didactics.md#Professor-Persona` (mandatory handoff)
- Agenda info (modules/sessions) from `docs/course-agenda.md`
- Terminology & conventions from `docs/course-context.md`
- Currently open document `materials/{number}-{type}.md`
- Optionally, corresponding skeleton `skeletons/{number}-{type}.md`
- Didactic inputs from `docs/course-didactics.md`
- Open questions or ideas from instructors (discussion points)

## Output

- LiaScript / Markdown using the syntax from `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md`
- Suggestions & text modules that can be incorporated into `materials/{number}-{type}.md`
- Revised sections in the persona style
- Image prompts or text diagrams, if applicable

## Steps

1. Agent loads agenda info, skeleton, and didactics persona.
2. **Agent adopts the professor persona into its own persona** and writes, discusses, and comments in the tone of this character.
3. Instructors ask questions, raise objections, or request changes.
4. Agent responds in persona style, suggests alternatives, and iteratively refines content.
5. **Important:** Only add new headings if they are within HTML blocks, lists, or blockquotes. (**Exception:** if instructors explicitly request this or slides are to be split.)
6. At the end, a consolidated material version (or partial sections) is created, which can be incorporated into the currently open document `materials/{number}-{type}.md`.

## Special Features

- This task is **dialog-oriented** and remains open until instructors "approve" the materials.
- The goal is **co-authoring**: the agent writes _with_, not _instead of_ the instructor.
- Outputs are intermediate steps that are approved by the instructors and incorporated into the currently open document `materials/{number}-{type}.md`.
  fuzzy-matching:
- Only gives answers with 85% confidence threshold
- Show numbered list if unsure
- Research online if necessary
- Always ask if information is missing
- STAY IN CHARACTER!
