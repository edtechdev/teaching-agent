- Course type from `didactics.md#course-type`
- Additional preferences (optional): color schemes, visual style, brand guidelines

## Output

- `visuals.md` (Markdown file)
- Structure based on `templates/visuals.yaml`

## Steps

1. Read title and abstract from `outline.md`.

6. Design course image generation guidelines (visual style, composition, lighting, mood).
7. Set image consistency rules to maintain visual coherence.
8. Define website color palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutral, semantic colors).
9. Specify typography (headings, body text, monospace fonts) matching the course style.
10. Create example prompts for logos, images, and diagrams based on course theme.
11. Fill the `templates/visuals.yaml` template with the results.
12. Save the file as `visuals.md`.
