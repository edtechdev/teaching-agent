# Task: create-image

## Purpose

Generates a detailed image prompt for course materials based on a user description, aligned with the visual style guide.
Creates professional, actionable prompts for AI image generators that maintain visual consistency with the course identity.

## Inputs

- User description: what should be visualized (provided as command parameter)
- Image style guidelines from `visuals.md#image-prompt-style`
- Website color palette from `visuals.md#website-colors`
- Course context from `docs/outline.md#abstract` (for thematic alignment)
- Course language from `docs/context.md` (Language field — for in-image text language)

## Output

- A detailed image prompt (displayed as formatted text)
- Always saved to `assets/prompts/image-{slug}.md` (created automatically if folder does not exist)

## Steps

1. Receive user description of what should be visualized.
2. Read image style guidelines from `visuals.md#image-prompt-style`.
3. Read color palette from `visuals.md#website-colors`.
4. Read course theme from `docs/outline.md#abstract` for context.
5. Read course language from `docs/context.md` (Language field, e.g., `de`, `en`). If `docs/context.md` is unavailable, infer the language from the user's description as fallback.
6. Analyze user description and extract:
   - Main subject/concept
   - Required elements or details
   - Intended use (diagram, illustration, header, etc.)
7. Combine user description with style guide parameters:
   - Visual style (photorealistic, illustrated, flat, etc.)
   - Color scheme (using palette from style guide)
   - Composition approach
   - Lighting and mood
   - Educational context
   - **In-image text language:** if the image may contain any visible text (labels, headings, titles, UI elements, captions), explicitly specify in the prompt that all such text must be in the course language (e.g., `"All text visible in the image must be written in German."`)
8. Generate a detailed, actionable prompt.
9. Include accessibility considerations (alt text suggestion).
10. Present the prompt in a clear format.
11. Save to `assets/prompts/image-{slug}.md` — always, without asking.
    Create the folder if it does not exist.
    Confirm: "Prompt saved: `assets/prompts/image-{slug}.md`"

## Output Format
